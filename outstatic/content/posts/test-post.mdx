# Finallyâ€¦ A Chair That ERASES Back Pain (While You Work)?

## (Endorsed by Top Orthopedic Surgeonsâ€¦ and Loved by 1,327 Office Workers)

<JohnsonBox title="WARNING:">
Your $1,200 "ergonomic" office chair is DESTROYING your spine.  
(Even if it "feels comfortable")
</JohnsonBox>

Hereâ€™s why:  

The human body was **never designed to sit 8 hours a day.**  

Study after study proves it:  

- Sitting increases disc pressure by **40%** vs standing ([NIH Research](https://example.com))  
- Office workers have **54% higher rates of herniated discs** ([Journal of Spine](https://example.com))  
- Low back pain costs Americans **$100 BILLION yearly** in lost productivity  

But standing desks arenâ€™t the answer either.  

Ask anyone whoâ€™s tried standing all day:  

â†’ Swollen feet  
â†’ Aching knees  
â†’ Neck stiffness  

**What if I told you thereâ€™s a third option?**

A NASA-inspired "posture shifting"    

- **Eliminates back pain** in 89% of users ([Clinical Trial Data](https://example.com))  
- **Boosts productivity** by 22% (University of Michigan Study)  
- **Fully covered** by HSA/FSA funds
